.TH cursetag
.SH NAME
CurseTag - NCurses based audio file tag editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "cursetag" [DIRECTORY]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
[DIRECTORY] is the directory in which to work. CurseTag only deals with the files in one single directory, and does not touch
subdirectories.
.PP
If no directory is given, the directory to use is read from stdin, so you can for instance write
.I "pwd | cursetag"
to use the current working directory.
.PP
If a valid directory was given, CurseTag will read the files in that directory and list those that are of a recognised audio file type
(currently supported: ogg, flac, mpeg). If there are no recognised audio files in the directory, CurseTag exists.

.B "Tag/filename interaction"
.PP
It is also possible to read the tags automatically from the filenames, or rename the files according to the tags.
This is accomplished with a control string containing some of the following wildcards:
.TP 8
%t
track title
.TP
%A
artist
.TP
%a
album
.TP
%y
year (date)
.TP
%n
track number
.TP
%N
total number of tracks (if missing, will be filled in automatically according to file count)
.TP
%d
disc number
.TP
%c
comment
.PP
Anything besides these wildcards is interpreted literally. For instance, if the current browsing directory is /home/user/music/Band/Albumname/ and the files are named "01. First Track.ogg" etc., the tags can be filled with the string "%A/%a/%n. %t".
.SH FILES
.PP
$XGD_CONFIG_HOME/.cursetag.conf
or
$HOME/.config/.cursetag.conf
