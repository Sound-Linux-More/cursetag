Basic
	aclocal
	automake --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
should work. The usual configure options are there, too.

Then, about the stuff that isn't quite standard:

CurseTag currently handles only flac, ogg vorbis, and mpeg layers 2&3.
In the future, ape (monkey's audio), aac (mp4), and mpc might be added;
wma probably not, 'cause it's evil.

For flac, you need libFLAC++; for ogg vorbis, libvorbisfile;
and for mpeg, id3lib. *None of these is required*! The only
required library is libncurses! Indeed, you can compile the
program without support for any audio formats. Not much use,
that, but it's doable.
