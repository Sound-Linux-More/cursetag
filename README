INTRODUCTION

This is a sort of a _explanation_ of CurseTag. For installation instructions,
see Makefile; for usage info, see the man page.

CurseTag is a text-based audio file tag (metadata) editor. It aims to be a
simplified, lightweight, non-graphical alternative for the quite popular tag
editor called EasyTag.

Advantages of CurseTag over EasyTag:
	- fully keyboard driven interface
	- starts up about 10 times faster, if not more
	- runs in textmode, even without X
	- much more simple
For disadvantages, see the "Limitations" section below.

CurseTag supports in principle the file types that TagLib does, which are
(according to TagLib's homepage; I have not tested all of these with CurseTag!):
Ogg Vorbis, MP3 (both ID3v1 and ID3v2), FLAC (with both ID3 and Vorbis tags),
MPC, Speex, WavPack, TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, and ASF.


LIMITATIONS

First off, CurseTag is not "EasyTag in text mode". It has significantly less
features, and this will not change much in the future.

At the moment, CurseTag does not even have any editable configuration. Some
kind of options will probably be added in the future.

CurseTag does not try to be as smart as EasyTag. Some examples:
- If a file has a weird extension, e.g. a vorbis file has extension ".mp3",
  you might run into some trouble.
- All tags are written in UTF-8 only.
- All tag handling is done on the most generic level, so the fine details
  of different file types are ignored.
- If you have crazy filenames containing escape characters and what not,
  don't be surprised if something goes wrong.

Compared to EasyTag, CurseTag does much less with regards to reading the tags.
If the file has non-standard tags or if its tags are in a weird encoding or
something else is not-strictly-standard, CurseTag will most likely fail to read
the tags in any usable way. The purpose of the program is to *write* the tags,
and to write them in a very simple way.

Not all the tags are editable, either. Not all the possible tags, and not even
all the tags editable in EasyTag. Embedded pictures are completely ignored.

Finally, there might be some bugs. Users of EasyTag (or any other tag editor
they like) might hold on to that piece of software in case CurseTag screws up
their metadata... Sorry in advance if that happens.
