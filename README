INTRODUCTION

This is a sort of a guide into using CurseTag. For installation instructions,
see INSTALL file.

CurseTag is a text-based audio file tag (metadata) editor. It aims to be a
simplified, lightweight, non-graphical alternative for the quite popular tag
editor called EasyTag.

In what follows, it will be assumed that the reader is at least somewhat
familiar with EasyTag. Taking a look at their homepage
	http:/easytag.sourceforge.net
should give some idea.



LIMITATIONS

First off, CurseTag is not "EasyTag in text mode". It has significantly less
features, and this will not change much in the future.

At the moment, CurseTag does not even have any editable configuration. Some
kind of options will probably be added in the future. Please make suggestions.

CurseTag does not try to be as smart as EasyTag. Some examples:
(1) If a file has extension ".ogg", then its tag is assumed to be an ogg
    vorbis tag, and if it is not, CurseTag will simply fail to process
	that file.
(2) All tags are written in UTF-8 only. Tags that are not UTF-8 might be read
    wrong or not at all.
(3) There is no support for deprecated versions of any of the audio formats.
(4) If you have crazy filenames containing escape characters and what not,
    don't be surprised if something goes wrong.

Compared to EasyTag, CurseTag does much less with regards to reading the tags.
If the file has non-standard tags or if its tags are in a weird encoding or
something else is not-strictly-standard, CurseTag will most likely fail to read
the tags in any usable way. The purpose of the program is to *write* the tags,
and to write them to follow the specifications.

Not all the tags are editable, either. Not all the possible tags, and not even
all the tags editable in EasyTag. Embedded pictures are ignored alltogether.

Finally, there might be some bugs. Users of EasyTag might hold on to that piece
of software in case CurseTag screws up their metadata... Sorry in advance if
that happens.

Regarding additional features in the future:
Mouse support does not sound necessary or even useful. Directory browser seems
cumbersome and not too beneficial. So does the mere possibility of switching
the directory without restarting the application. I'd rather keep it simple.

If your desires and opinions differ from mine, feel free to fork or ignore.

Formats and operations supported at the moment:
Mpeg (mp3, mp2) metadata can be read and written.
Ogg Vorbis and FLAC data is currently only viewable; modifications cannot be
saved.
Mp4, ape, mpc, and wavpack files are recognised, but there is no functionality.

I don't care either way.
